# Belly Button Biodiversity
Building an interactive webpage with data visualization using JavaScript and Poltly.

## Overview
Scientists from Improbable Beef(TM) are investigating bacteria from the human belly button to find the types that synthesize proteins that mimic the taste of real meat. To visualize the data, we built an interactive webpage so that volunteers can view the results of thier belly button analyses. If they contain the right composition of bacteria, they may be able to sell their samples to ImprobableBeef(TM) for use in their meat subsitute recipe.
